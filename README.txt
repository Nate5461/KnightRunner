The aspect ratio all changed when I went to build, If you want me to resubmit I can but this just happened and is extremely frustrating, I apologize

The game is a 2d platformer, At main menu you can start or view the leaderboard or exit. At any point in the game you can pause and restart or exit. The first level you are a knight and face a skeleton. Once you beat the skelton or get past, next level. In the next level if you go back off the ledge you can face the necromancer in chess (e to interact) then follow the dialog cues.

In the chess game, You click on a piece then the square you want to move, If it's an invalid move it won't let you, when you want to change the piece you move after you have already clicked on one you can just double click. You can castle by moving the king where he would go when castling. You can forfiet at any time.

I tried to make the chess ai as easy as i could but it is still quite hard, I can beat it maybe 50% of the time, Use online engine if chess isn't your thing to see necromancer functionality.

Once done chess there is a goblin to fight then the end, where you enter your score. 

Controls:
